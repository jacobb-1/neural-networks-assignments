# Neural Networks Assignments

This repository contains my university assignments related to neural networks, delivered as Jupyter Notebooks and exported PDFs.  
The works include implementations and experiments with **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**.


## Contents

- [LSTM](./LSTM) — Assignment on Long Short-Term Memory networks.  
- [SOM_Colors](./SOM_Colors) — Assignment on Self-Organizing Maps.  
- [SOM_Pokemon](./SOM_Pokemon) — Assignment on Self-Organizing Maps.  
- [MLP_MNIST_CUDA](./MLP_Cuda) — CUDA implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for MNIST digit classification.  


## Folders
Each assignment folder includes:
- The original Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).  
- The exported report (`.pdf`).
